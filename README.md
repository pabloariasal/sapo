# The Sapo Programming Language üê∏

Sapo is a hobby programming language written in Rust that I'm developing during lockdown.

## Design

Sapo hasn't been fully designed yet. The basic idea is for it to become a scripting multi-purpose language similar to python and Lua.

A web-assembly compiler is possible if I find enough dedication.
Follow the project if you are interested in its development.
